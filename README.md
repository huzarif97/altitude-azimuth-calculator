# altitude-azimuth-calculator
Find out what coordinates you need to point your telescope at to find a specific point in the sky.

This calculation is implemented using the process at http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/altaz.html

To use the calculator one needs to first know:
1. **Latitude** of observing location
2. **Longitude** of observing location
3. **Right Ascension** of location in the sky
4. **Declination** of location in the sky

**ALL ABOVE VALUES MUST BE IN DECIMAL FORMAT**

Happy Stargazing
